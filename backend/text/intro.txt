{CHARACTER-1}, {CHARACTER-2}, {CHARACTER-3} need your help!
They're lost in a strange world, the unwitting and unwilling heroes of a story that they didn't want to be a part of.
Now you - that's right, YOU - need to guide them through that story.
Think of yourself as an angel (or devil), sitting on their shoulders, whispering in their ears.
Each turn, you'll make suggestions and interact with your characters.
Speaking of the characters - on the right -> of the screen, you can see more info about your characters - their histories, personalities, skills.
Be creative, be bold, be kind, be cruel. Do whatever you like - the world is your oyster!

So - what will you do next?
