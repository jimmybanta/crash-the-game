Welcome to Crash - an AI-generated, interactive story game.
You've met your characters, witnessed them crash land and wake up in a strange place.
Now you need to guide them through the story.
Think of yourself as an angel (or devil), sitting on their shoulders, whispering in their ears.
Each turn, you'll make suggestions and interact with the characters.
Speaking of the characters - on the right -> of the screen, you can see more info about your characters - their histories, personalities, skills.
Be creative, be bold, be kind, be cruel. Do whatever you like - the world is your oyster!

So - what will you do next?
